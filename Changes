   - fixed up format of Makefile that caused a make error on Solaris
     (thanks to Lupe Christoph).
   
   - made sure the t/httpd/create_reg.pl and t/httpd/create_conf.pl
     scripts made their files owner-writable. (thanks to Lupe Christoph)
   
   - rewrote the INSTALL document so that it's clearer (hopefully).
   
   - wrote a summary of the documentation in the various modules
     in the distribution - see the summary by doing "perldoc Taco".
     (thanks to Gerald Richter)

0.03
   - Taco::ArgTable->to_hash now behaves correctly when a parameter
     is in more than one layer: the parameter in the top layer
     takes precedence.
   
   - Fixed t/httpd/create_reg.pl, which tried to load the nonpresent
     module Taco::DB.  (thanks to Gary Ashton-Jones)

0.04
   - Fixed a couple of porting bugs in the TacoRelayHost section of
     Apache::Taco.pm that prevented TacoRelayHost from working.
   
   - Taco::ArgLayer::set_arg and Taco::ArgLayer::add_arg now explicitly
     look for a HASH reference when deciding whether to wrap incoming values
     in a hash reference - previously they just looked for any kind of
     reference.
