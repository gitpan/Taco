   - made sure the t/httpd/create_reg.pl and t/httpd/create_conf.pl
     scripts made their files owner-writable. (thanks to Lupe Christoph)
   
   - rewrote the INSTALL document so that it's clearer (hopefully).

   - Taco::ArgTable->to_hash now behaves correctly when a parameter
     is in more than one layer: the parameter in the top layer
     takes precedence.
   
   - Fixed t/httpd/create_reg.pl, which tried to load the nonpresent
     module Taco::DB.
