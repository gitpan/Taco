To install Taco, do these steps:

 0) install mod_perl
 1) edit Makefile.PL
 2) perl Makefile.PL
 3) make
 4) make test
 5) make install
 6) set up ServiceRegistry.pm in site_perl/Taco

The details:

 0) Taco runs under mod_perl, a Perl module for the Apache web server.
    You need to completely install mod_perl before starting the Taco
    installation process.  See http://perl.apache.org/ for more information
    about mod_perl.

 1) In order to run the tests in step 4 using a real web server, you'll 
    need to edit Makefile.PL and change the value of the variables 
    $HTTPD, $PORT, $USER, and $GROUP.  $HTTPD should be the full path
    to a mod_perl enabled Apache server.
 
 4) This process will attempt to actually start up a real web server
    running Taco.  If you get errors trying to start up the server,
    check your work in step 1.  You may need to do this step as root,
    so that the server can run under the $USER and $GROUP you specified
    in step 1.
 
 5) This step will copy the Taco.pm module, a bunch of Taco::*.pm modules,
    and Apache::Taco.pm into your Perl's site_perl/ directory.  It will
    also put some man pages into your Perl's man/ directory.
 
 6) If this is the first time you're installing Taco, you should copy
    the Taco/ServiceRegistry_dist.pm file to Taco/ServiceRegistry.pm, and
    then create some services.  If you're upgrading from an existing Taco
    installation, you can skip this step.  See "perldoc Taco::ServiceRegistry" 
    for more info.


If these steps don't work for you, you could theoretically just copy
the Perl files from lib/ into your Perl library directory, because so
far Taco is all regular Perl, no C extensions or any of that stuff.
But it's best if you go through the above process.  Let me know if you
have problems with it.

Please see the documentation for Apache::Taco for information on how to
make Taco pages and serve them under Apache's mod_perl.
