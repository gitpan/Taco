To install Taco, do this:

   perl Makefile.PL *
   make
   make test
   make install
   <in site_perl/Taco, copy ServiceRegistry_dist.pm to ServiceRegistry.pm> **

If that really doesn't work for you, you could theoretically just copy
the Perl files from lib/ into your Perl library directory, because so
far Taco is all regular Perl, no C extensions or any of that stuff.
But it's best if you go through the above process.

The installation process will install the Taco.pm module, a bunch of
Taco::*.pm modules, and Apache::Taco.pm.

Taco probably only works on Unix.  It's been tested under Digital Unix
and Linux.

Please see the documentation for Apache::Taco for information on how to
make Taco pages and serve them under Apache's mod_perl.

* The "make test" step will attempt to actually start up a real
mod_perl-enabled Apache server and serve some Taco pages using it.  To
get this to work, you'll need to edit Makefile.PL and change the first
few variables - they tell Taco where to find an Apache server, what
port to run the test server on, and what user & group to run the
server as.  You may need to run the "make test" step as root.

** If this is the first time you're installing Taco, you should copy
the Taco/ServiceRegistry_dist.pm file to Taco/ServiceRegistry.pm, and
then create some services.  This step is necessary so that upgrading
or reinstalling Taco won't overwrite your existing ServiceRegistry.pm
file.  See "perldoc Taco::ServiceRegistry" for more info.
